/*
 * Coin Path
 *
 * Given a list of positive integers nums, you can choose any number from the list and
 * sum it up. If the sum is divisible by 3, then the sum is a valid coin path.
 *
 * Return the largest sum of valid coin paths. If it is not possible to choose any valid
 * coin path, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: The largest sum of valid coin paths is 12 = 4 + 4 + 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,7]
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation: The largest sum of valid coin paths is 18 = 4 + 4 + 3 + 7.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,7,7,7]
 * Output: 24
 * Explanation: The largest sum of valid coin paths is 24 = 4 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 7.
