 * Fibonacci Number
 *
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
 *
 * F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
 * F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
 * Given n, calculate F(n).
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= n <= 30
 *
