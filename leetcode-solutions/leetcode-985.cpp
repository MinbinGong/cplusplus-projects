/**
 * 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries
 *
 * We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.
 *
 * For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1], we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is the sum of the even values of A.
 *
 * (Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array A.)
 *
 * Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
 * Output: [8,6,2,4]
 * Explanation:
 * At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: A = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= A.length <= 10000
 * -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
 * 1 <= queries.length <= 10000
 * -10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000
 * 0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length
